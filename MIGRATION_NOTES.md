# Geth Dependency Removal Notes

## Summary
Successfully removed all dependencies on `github.com/luxfi/geth` from the crypto package by implementing the necessary types and utilities locally.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Common Types (`common/types.go`)
- Implemented `Hash` type (32-byte array) with all necessary methods
- Implemented `Address` type (20-byte array) with EIP-55 compliant checksumming
- Added common big integer constants (Big0, Big1, etc.)
- Added helper functions for hex encoding/decoding

### 2. Created Hex Utilities (`common/hexutil/`)
- Implemented hex encoding/decoding with 0x prefix support
- Added types for JSON marshaling (Big, Uint64, Uint, Bytes)
- Supports all the hex utility functions previously imported from geth

### 3. Created Math Utilities (`common/math/`)
- Implemented big integer math functions (BigPow, BigMax, BigMin)
- Added PaddedBigBytes for encoding big integers with padding
- Implemented safe arithmetic operations (SafeAdd, SafeSub, SafeMul, SafeDiv)
- Added other utility functions like ReadBits, U256, S256

### 4. Created RLP Encoding (`rlp/encode.go`)
- Minimal RLP encoder implementation supporting:
  - Basic types: []byte, string, uint64, *big.Int
  - Common types: common.Address, common.Hash
  - Lists: []interface{}
- Sufficient for crypto package needs (primarily CreateAddress function)

### 5. Updated All Imports
- Changed all imports from `github.com/luxfi/geth/*` to `github.com/luxfi/crypto/*`
- Updated files:
  - crypto.go
  - crypto_test.go
  - signature_test.go
  - signature_cgo.go
  - secp256k1/ethereum.go
  - kzg4844/kzg4844.go
  - kzg4844/kzg4844_ckzg_cgo.go

## Testing
- All existing tests pass
- No functionality changes, only dependency removal
- The CreateAddress function works correctly with the new RLP encoder

## Benefits
1. No external dependency on geth
2. Reduced binary size (only includes necessary code)
3. Better control over the implementation
4. Easier to maintain and update

## Notes
- The implementations are minimal but complete for crypto package needs
- If more RLP functionality is needed in the future, the encoder can be extended
- The common types match the geth interface exactly for compatibility
